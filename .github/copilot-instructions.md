This project is a PowerShell 7 automation and validation toolkit for Windows device build certification. Follow the standards and requirements as detailed in the project documentation and user instructions.

# Additional Copilot Instructions

- All CLI menu documentation must follow the structure, indentation, and inline context comments as shown in `.website/user-guides/menu-structure.md`.
- Menu documentation must use the ASCII-art, indented, and annotated style for clarity and accessibility, with context for each action (e.g., "opens in Notepad", "stub", etc.).
- Always check for and respect recent manual documentation edits, especially in `.website/` and key Markdown files, before making automated changes.
- Use EN-AU spelling for all documentation and comments, except where user-facing output requires otherwise.
- All scripts must use the robust, root-based module import pattern and centralised logging as implemented in this project.
- The `.website/` folder is the canonical source for documentation; keep all scripts and documentation in sync.
- **CLI modules must never redirect to menus themselvesâ€”always return control to the caller for consistent menu flow. Menu navigation and flow must be managed by the calling (wrapper) function or script.**
- When introducing new properties to objects, always ensure they are defined at creation to avoid runtime errors.
- All menu and state logic must be modular, with state recalculation and redraw logic centralised and reusable.
- All CLI/menu changes must be regression-tested after every change, and all regressions must be fixed before proceeding.
- Never assume a property exists on a PSCustomObject unless it is explicitly defined at creation.
